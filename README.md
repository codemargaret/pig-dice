## Description
_Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die. After each roll, the player decides whether to "hold" or roll again. If a 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing for that turn, and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player to get 100 points wins. The app displays the current roll and total score for each player._
